# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Project-

Project Summary: Human handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made in many different ways, which makes it difficult for machines to recognize them. By taking handwritten digit recognition projects, you will be able to give machines the capability to recognize human handwritten digits. Using the image of a digit, handwritten digit recognition is able to identify the digit in the image.
